# Chess-SFML
A simple chess game made using SFML. 

I'd like to announce that I've had some technical issues and a few other things going on and haven't had as much time to work on any projects. The biggest thing that messed me up was the fact that my computer broke, but I've acquired another one and will be uploading other projects as soon as I can. 

Things that are still missing on this game:

-En passant; special pawn move.

-Castling; special king and rook move.

-Detecting Check; for both players.

-Checkmate; game does not stop or declare a winner yet.

I'll implement the remaining features and upload changes as fast as I can.

********* These projects are basically for me to practice my C++ and just gain experience making larger things. Feel free to peruse my stuff and pm me if you have any questions. ***********
